        He was elected the President unanimously by Bharatiya Janata Party and opposition Indian National 
        Congress in the year 2002. He served his term from 2002 to 2007 and then returned to his sacred

        Abdul Kalam had to struggle a lot to reach the success he has achieved in his career.
         He has been a live manifestation of the strength he describes in this quote. 
         Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam or A.P.J Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October, 
         1931 to a humble Tamil Muslim family. He had to sell newspapers his his childhood in order
          to manage the finances of the family. He was an average student in school but his keen 
          interest in studies and his hard work are what helped him achieve success in his career.

        Kalam graduated in Physics from Tiruchirapalli’s St Joseph’s College,
         which was affiliated with the University of Madras, in 1954.
          In the year 1955, Kalam pursued Aerospace Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology.
          Kalam wanted to become a fighter pilot for IAF but missed the opportunity as there were only
           eight positions and Kalam qualified ninth.
